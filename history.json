        "content": "The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. When sunlight reaches the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters molecules and tiny particles in the air. These particles scatter the sunlight in all directions. However, the shorter wavelengths of light, such as blue and violet, are scattered more than the longer wavelengths, like red and orange.\n\nSince blue light is scattered more, it is dispersed in all directions and becomes visible to our eyes from all parts of the sky. This is why we perceive the sky as blue during the day. In contrast, the longer wavelengths of light, like red and orange, are scattered less and tend to pass straight through the atmosphere, resulting in the colors we see during sunrise and sunset.\n\nIt's important to note that the sky can appear different colors under certain conditions, such as during sunrise or sunset when the sunlight has to pass through a thicker portion of the atmosphere, causing more scattering of shorter wavelengths and giving rise to warm hues like red, orange, and pink."
